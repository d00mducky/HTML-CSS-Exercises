            Hello! My name is Kyle Perra and I am a Computer Science student at Central
            Washington University.
          </li>
          <li>
            Born in Oakland, California - I grew up in a neighboring town called Concord.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though I went to school in Concord, I spent a great deal of time in Lamorinda
            County where I played rugby religiously.
          </li>
          <li>
            When contemplating where I might go to university, I had no shortage of
            options - though I wanted the opportunity to play rugby collegiately. After
            some traveling and debate, I chose Central and my life has never been the
            same!
          </li>
          <li>
            Someday, I do hope to return to California's Bay Area - but certainly I have
            found a new home, here in Ellensburg.
          </li>
